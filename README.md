# `effects-benchmark`

Various Haskell effects systems benchmark.

Note: Alexis King did an amazing work and [talk](https://github.com/lexi-lambda/talks/tree/master/2020-06-effects), focusing on micro-benchmarking each effects systems, focusing on the raw performances.
However, it became an authority argument in most of the debates I had, while in production code there's IOs and computations.
Have a look at [results](./RESULTS.md) to have idea of the impact of each of them.
